     <hr>
     <p>Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time.
     The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm
     (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness
     and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes
     termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may
     emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with
     a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping;
     there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without
     instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The
     word derives from Greek (mousike; "art of the Muses").</p>
