      <a class="button">Metal</a>
      <p>Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in
      the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United
      States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands
      that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by
      highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall
      loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated
      with aggression and machismo.</p>

      <a class="button">Reggae</a>
      <p>Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term
      also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968
      single by Toots and the Maytals "Do the Reggay" was the first popular song to
      use the word "reggae," effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a
      global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most
      types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes
      a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento
      as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans
      R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the
      earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social
      gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field,
      being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady.
      It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat,
      and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock
      steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.</p>

      <a class="button">Pop</a>
      <p>Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form
        in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid 1950s. The terms
        "popular music" and "pop music" are often used interchangeably, although
        the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles.
        "Pop" and "rock" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they
        were increasingly used in opposition from each other.</p>

      <a class="button">Acoustic</a>
      <p>Acoustic music is music that solely or primarily uses instruments that
        produce sound through acoustic means, as opposed to electric or electronic
        means. The retronym "acoustic music" appeared after the advent of electric
        instruments, such as the electric guitar, electric violin, electric organ
        and synthesizer.
It has its origins in the folk music of the 1960s.[not in citation given]
Following the increasing popularity of the television show MTV Unplugged during
the 1990s, acoustic (though in most cases still electrically amplified) performances
by musicians (most notably grunge bands) who usually rely on electronic instruments
became colloquially referred to as "unplugged" performances. The trend has also been
dubbed as "acoustic rock" in some cases.</p>

      <a class="button">RnB</a>
      <p>Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular
        African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally
        used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban
        African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy,
        insistent beat" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues
        music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano,
        one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists.
        R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and
        the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs
        and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.</p>
